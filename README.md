# curriculum_cooler
My simple CV for new opportunities.

https://github.com/CoolerVoid/curriculum_cooler/blob/master/CoolerVOid_CV.pdf

I don't have a lot of true friends to help me. Sure, I have “IRC, Facebook and twitter friends” and people who might like me, but not a lot of people who really know me or offer to job to me.

If you understand and like my opensource work, please spread my curriculum for your firm.
I work for 30000 USD per year.

Thank you.
